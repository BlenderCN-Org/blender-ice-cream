- Left click to select
- Shift+right click to place 3D cursor
- 3D cursor is where newly placed objects appear
- Scroll using the scroll wheel
- Scrolling using track pad might be possible using the "emulare three button mouse" setting?
- Middle button and dragging seems to orbit around the midpoint of the current viewport (not the selected object or the 3D cursor)
- Shift + middle mouse button to drag the viewport around
- Period key on numpad to zoom in on the current selection (not sure how to do without a num pad)
- G key to drag selection around in the viewport
- R key to rotate the selection around its center
- RX, RY, RZ to rotate around a specific axis
- S to scale, SX, SY, SX to scale around an axis
- Shift+S+1 cursor to world origin (3D cursor at 0,0,0)
- Shift+A add to 3D cursor
- X+Enter delete selected object
- Ctrl+0 view from default camera?
- 1 front ortho
- 2 perspective - hold to spin around X (direction 1)
- 3 right ortho
- 4 perspective - hold to spin around Z (direction 1)
- 5 perspective/ortho alternate
- 6 perspective - hold to spin around Z (direction 2)
- 7 top ortho
