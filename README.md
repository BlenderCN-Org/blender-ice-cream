# Blender Ice Cream

Notes from following the tutorial from CG Geek.

## [Part 1: 3D Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppASl6yaguU)

- Left click to select
- Shift+right click to place 3D cursor
- 3D cursor is where newly placed objects appear
- Scroll using the scroll wheel
- Scrolling using track pad might be possible using the "emulare three button mouse" setting?
- Middle button and dragging seems to orbit around the midpoint of the current viewport (not the selected object or the 3D cursor)
- Shift + middle mouse button to drag the viewport around
- Period key on numpad to zoom in on the current selection (not sure how to do without a num pad)
- G key to drag selection around in the viewport
- R key to rotate the selection around its center
- RX, RY, RZ to rotate around a specific axis
- S to scale, SX, SY, SX to scale around an axis
- Shift+S+1 cursor to world origin (3D cursor at 0,0,0)
- Shift+A add to 3D cursor
- X+Enter delete selected object
- Ctrl+0 view from default camera?
- 1 front ortho
- 2 perspective - hold to spin around X (direction 1)
- 3 right ortho
- 4 perspective - hold to spin around Z (direction 1)
- 5 perspective/ortho alternate
- 6 perspective - hold to spin around Z (direction 2)
- 7 top ortho
- 8 perspective - hold to spin around X (direction 1)
- 9 perspective - hold to spin around Z ??
- Actually 4682 are probably relative to the view, spinning in place of mouse dragging
- ~ to display the view menu
- Tab to toggle object and edit mode
- AA in edit to unselect all
- A in edit to select all
- B box select - selects only vertices, edges and faces visible to the camera (not the backside)
- Edit mode X ray button to enable box select to select back face items - TODO shortcut?
- G in edit mode to translate and hold Ctrl after it to snap to grid, click to commit
- Ctrl+R in edit to introduce a cut, scroll wheel to increase cut count, click to slide, next click to commit
- Alt+click to select a loop of vertices
- GX, GY, GZ to translate across a particular axis
- Subdivision surface modifier to basically pretend the geometry has more granularity
- W for object context menu not working with left mouse: https://developer.blender.org/T59045
- W to cycle select modes with left mouse thoâ€¦
- Object context menu > shade smooth
- Solidify modifier to add thickness to mesh made of only faces
- E in edit to extrude, EX, EY, EZ
